<h1>Sorting Algorithm Visualizer</h1>

This project provides a visual representation of various sorting algorithms, helping users understand the step-by-step process of how different algorithms sort data. It supports interactive features like adjusting the array size and sorting speed, offering an educational tool for learning and teaching sorting algorithms. The project integrates key web development technologies to ensure a responsive and user-friendly experience:

<h1>Features</h1>

Array Generation: Creates a random array of bars, each representing a different value.

Adjustable Settings: Allows users to change the size of the array and the speed of the sorting visualization.

Sorting Algorithms: Implements and visualizes the following algorithms:
Bubble Sort
Selection Sort
Insertion Sort
Merge Sort
Quick Sort

Visual Indicators: Highlights the sorting process with colors, where sorted elements turn green.

<h1>Technologies Utilized</h1>

HTML: Structures the webpage and user interface.

CSS: Styles the webpage, making it visually appealing.

JavaScript: Implements the sorting algorithms and interactive functionalities.

<h1>Project Structure</h1>

index.html: Main HTML file that sets up the webpage structure.

styles.css: CSS file that styles the visualizer.

script.js: JavaScript file containing the logic for array generation, sorting algorithms, and visualization.
